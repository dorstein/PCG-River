# Procedural River Generator

This project contains a heihgtmap generator, which also can add rivers and waterbodies to the heightmap. The generator is also able to create a Terrain based on the heightmap.

## Abtract

Complex systems are currently used to generate virtual terrains with rivers and water bodies. Those systems were presented, categorised and discussed during this thesis. With the view of video game production, simpler models which can be quickly implemented are desired. These alternate approaches should fulfil the requirements of a nearly realistic, naturally formed river. Three approaches were implemented, a simulation, a recursive and rule-based one. There are based on findings during this thesis. Also, they have the same data structure a list of vertices ordered as a grid. 
In lack of method on how to measure a realistic river; an empirical evaluation was conducted. Human subjects evaluated each approach, as well as real footage (derived) and false images â€” results show that the recursive approach was perceived as nearly as naturalistic as real footage. The simulation only showed a tendency towards naturalism whereas the rule-based approach was more unrealistic. The conclusion is drawn that is does not require complex systems and simulations to generate nearly naturalistic rivers and water bodies. However, each approach still needs enhancement as well as more interactivity in order to be useful in production.
